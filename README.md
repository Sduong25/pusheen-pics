# Pusheen!
Pics for the app Pusheen!

## Steps:
1. Find a pic you like that isn't on the app.
2. Fork the repositiory
3. Name the pic DD-MM-YY-username and add it to the "Request" folder.
5. Create a push request
4. When I have the time I will add it to the app!

*Or if you fould a link to the image or have a direct link, post a text file (.txt, .md, etc.) place it in the Request folder w/ the same DD-MM-YY-username format.*
